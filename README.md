1. Task 1 - Ansible script used to create and build app locally.

2. Task 2 - Terraform and Ansible used to create and build script using EC2 on an ASG with user data to bootstrap it. I made the Terraform apply interactive (leaving the default values blank) to allow for customization.

3. Task 3 - Using Cloudwatch metrics and log steam I'd monitor the EC2 instance. Cloudwatch included in Task 2.
